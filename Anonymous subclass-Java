During one of my interview, I was asked "If we can instantiate an abstract class?"

My reply was "No. we can't". But, interviewer told me "Wrong, we can."

I argued a bit on this. Then he told me to try this myself at home.

abstract class my {
    public void mymethod() {
        System.out.print("Abstract");
    }
}

class poly {
    public static void main(String a[]) {
        my m = new my() {};
        m.mymethod();
    }
}
Here, I'm creating instance of my class and calling method of abstract class. Can anyone please explain this to me? Was I really wrong during my interview?
